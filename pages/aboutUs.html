        <h3>David Langan</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Groom</p>
        <p>Say hi to the groom. A devilishly handsome man from Maryland, born
          and raised. Playing soccer was my hobby through college and while on
          the field I caught the eye of my beautiful bride to be. The rest is
          history. But for real now. I am the middle child of three boys born
          to my wonderful parents, Mr. and Mrs. Tom and Wendy Langan. I
          enjoyed growing up in the quite suburbs of Baltimore. As a child
          I explored the woods every chance I had to be outside. Now that I
          work in a lab, I am worried I am not getting enough vitamin D...
          corny nerd humor. Today I enjoy relaxing with our wonderful cat,
          Lucello Lumiere Malcolm Lanister Langan and Natalie whenever I get
          a break from reading my scientific journals. I hope that in a couple
          years I'll be a doctor and paying her back for helping me through
          my studies.</p>

        <h3>Natalie Hernandez</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Bride</p>
        <p>Let me formally introduce myself. I am the bride to be, 24 year
          old Maryland native, Natalie J Hernandez. I come from a fierce
          family with a vivacious Latino heritage. Maybe you'll meet a lot of
          them at the wedding <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria hidden="true"></i>.
          When I was young I spent my time reading, painting, and playing every
          sport. Which lead me to meet David on the field... well I wasn't
          playing, but I was a keen spectator. Today I enjoy activities like
          hiking and receiving engagement rings at the top of mountains. When
          I am not outside with David I like exploring art galleries, watching
          foreign movies (Especially dramas), trying food I have never had,
          and playing with my adorable feline friend, Cello. Read more about
          him after us!</p>

        <h3>Luciello</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Cat</p>
        <p>This fierce feline was born on August, 16th 2015 in the jungles of
          Annapolis. He is a young boy who looks good for his age. He has
          learned the ease of having people wait on him day and night. We
          became his owners after his previous family could not provide for
          him.  He relaxed at the Arundel Humane society for a short while
          before joining our family last year. He now roams our apartment
          chasing flies and enjoying the occasional piece of food we drop.
          At night he prowls the rooms and roars at the doors to keep away
          unwanted guests.  While we are away for work he is probably being
          mischievous and climbing on things he should not. With years comes
          wisdom and he knows many tricks. He continues to add new tricks to
          his repertoire and soon we’ll have him doing spins.  His bushy tail
          may make you feel that he is unhappy, but he loves to be picked up
          and cuddled so don’t be shy when saying hello to Cello aka "Lucello
          Lumiere Malcom Lanister Langan".</p>

      <p><span style="font-size: 2em">W</span>e had seen each other on campus, but
        never talked until the school’s end of the year outdoor festival. Our first
        spark came when I promised to get us onto the roof of the science building.
        The attempt failed, but our new found connection had been lit. I took every
        chance to spend the last week of school with her. Each night we stayed up
        until dawn sharing stories instead of studying for finals. Summer break was
        looming and time apart could dim our new relationship. Fortunately, we
        lived only an hour apart, and as you can tell I made every effort to be
        with her. Now 4.5 years later, we are ready for the ultimate adventure.
        At 2016 summer’s end I was moving to start medical school. To convince her
        to pack, move to the city, and change jobs I made her a lifelong commitment.</p>

        <p>I incorporated our love of nature by booking a cabin at Shenandoah
        National Park for the 4th of July weekend. I got her off work and kept the
        trip a secret. Friday morning, after a long drive, we began our hike up
        Old Rag Mountain. Near the peak, I set up my camera and jumped out onto a
        rocky precipice overlooking the forest. I convinced her to jump out with me
        for the perfect picture. With the camera rolling and a valley of cold teal
        trees kissed by the early morning mist behind us, I pulled out the ring.
        I said, “Will you marry me?" Silence. Having hiked 4 hours and our hearts
        racing, it took a moment, so I asked again. “Yes,” she said with a tear and
        a smile. We didn’t look pretty having hiked for hours, but it was true and
        the moment pure. The spot represented what we wanted, to skirt the edge
        precariously, but hold each other the whole way. An applause came from on
        looking hikers who helped us capture the moment in the picture we have shown.
        During the rest of the trip we saw bears, slept in a cabin, and ate at the
        4star lodge. But my favorite part was the drive home when I grabbed her hand
        to see the ring I designed to represent our lives intertwining.</p>
